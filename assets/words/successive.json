For example, if someone says they have gone to the gym for 10 consecutive days, it means they went to the gym for 10 days in a row without skipping a day.\n\nTo summarize, consecutive refers to something that happens without any breaks, while successive refers to something that happens in a sequence with some breaks or interruptions in between.",

A company might have successive rounds of lay-offs as they try to reduce costs.\n\nGradual describes a slow but steady change or process, while successive describes a sequence of events that occur one after the other.",

For example, “The subsequent investigation found no evidence of foul play.”.\n\nIn simpler terms, subsequent means something that happens after another event or action, while successive means a series of events or actions that happen one after the other, usually quickly.\n\nIf you’re talking about events that happen over a longer period of time, use subsequent. If you’re talking about events that happen quickly one after the other, use successive.",
