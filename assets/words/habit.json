Twirling one's hair is a mannerism, as it is a distinctive behavior that is characteristic of an individual.\n\nHabits can be positive or negative, while mannerisms are neither good nor bad. A person's habits can be changed with effort, while mannerisms are more difficult to change as they often occur unconsciously.\n\nBoth words are applicable in describing human behavior, but habits are generally more ingrained and have a greater impact on a person's life, while mannerisms are more superficial and less significant.",
