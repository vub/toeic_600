For example, you might say \"I need to maintain my car\" - meaning you need to take care of it, get it serviced regularly, make necessary repairs, etc., in order to keep it running well.\n\nKeep up is used for activities or actions that you want to continue doing without losing momentum, while maintain is used for objects or things that you want to keep in good condition or prevent from deteriorating.",
