It's how they react or respond to something based on their attitude.\n\nFor example, if someone has a positive attitude towards school, they may believe that education is important and enjoyable.\n\nHowever, if someone has a negative attitude towards school, they may believe that it's boring or a waste of time. Their behavior may reflect this by skipping class, not paying attention in class, or not completing homework.\n\nAttitude is about thoughts and beliefs, and behavior is about actions and conduct. While attitude can affect behavior, they are two distinct concepts.",
