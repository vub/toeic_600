The difference is that motive refers to a person's internal desire or intention to do something, while reason refers to an explanation or justification for their actions.\n\nFor example, a person might have a motive for committing a crime, such as revenge or greed. A person might have a reason for breaking the law, such as self-defense or necessity.\n\nMotive describes a person's personal or emotional motivation for doing something, while reason describes a logical or practical explanation for their actions.",
