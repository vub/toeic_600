It usually refers to something that is more persistent and noticeable, like a buzzing mosquito or a nagging person.\n\nWhen someone irritates you, their behavior is likely to continue and consistently bother you over time.\n\nBother describes a mild annoyance caused by something insignificant, while irritate describes a stronger annoyance caused by something more persistent or troublesome.",
