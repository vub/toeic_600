It refers to activities that are generally boring and tiresome because they require a lot of time, attention or patience.\n\nThe main difference between the two words is that bore refers to something that is uninteresting, whereas tedious refers to something that is monotonous, repetitive, and wears you out because it's a long-term task.",
