So, when something is ample, it means that it is enough or adequate.\n\nFor example, if you have ample time to complete your homework, it means you have enough time to finish it without rushing.\n\nAbundant is used when you want to emphasize that there is more than enough of something, while ample describes when the quantity is enough or sufficient for what is needed.",

But you would say a bountiful harvest as it implies that it is a gift or a generous amount.\n\nAbundant is used for more general contexts of being ample, while bountiful is often used in the context of a gift or generosity.",

Both refer to something that is existing or available in large quantities.\n\nCopious is often used to describe something that is not only plentiful, but also more than what is necessary or expected.\n\nFor example, you might use the word copious to describe a copious amount of notes that someone took during a lecture, implying that they took an excessive amount of notes.\n\nSimilarly, you might say that someone has a copious vocabulary, meaning that they know an impressive amount of words.\n\nIn summary, both abundant and copious mean that there is a lot of something, but copious implies an excess or abundance that goes beyond what is usual or necessary.",

For example, we can say that food is plentiful at a party, which means that there is a sufficient amount of food at that specific location and time.\n\nAbundant is used for general things in general terms, while plentiful describes enough things in specific terms.",
