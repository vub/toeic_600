For example, a journalist might scrutinize a politician's statements in order to uncover any deceits or hidden agendas.\n\nBoth words can be used in a range of contexts, but examination is often associated with academic or professional evaluations, while scrutiny is more commonly used to describe close investigation or critical evaluation.",

A scientist might scrutinize a piece of data to check the accuracy of the results.",

For example, one might say \"I gave the contract a thorough perusal before signing it.\".\n\nPerusal is more focused on reading and understanding, while scrutiny is more focused on examining and investigating in a critical way.",
