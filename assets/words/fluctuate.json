It means to go back and forth between different options or ideas, often with hesitation or uncertainty.\n\nFor example, a person might waver between two job offers, unsure of which one to choose. Or a politician might waver on a controversial issue, trying to balance competing interests and opinions.\n\nFluctuate is more about continuous variation, while waver is more about fluctuation in a hesitant or uncertain way.",
