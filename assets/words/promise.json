Guarantees are often associated with products or services, and they usually come with a written agreement.\n\nIn a nutshell, a guarantee is a stronger and more formal commitment than a promise. Guarantees are applicable in situations where people want proof of assurance in contracts, agreements, or services, while promises are better suited for informal agreements or personal relationships.",

It's applicable when we are making a long-term or formal commitment, such as in business or politics.",

            "wordRoot": "Vow",
            "wordDefinition": "Both promise and vow mean to give someone your solemn word that you will do something.\n\nHowever, promise is generally a commitment to do something without any formal or religious context, whereas vow is a solemn promise made before God or in a religious setting.\n\nFor example, if you tell your friend that you will help them with their homework later, that is a promise, but if you make a promise to God to always be faithful to your spouse, that would be a vow.\n\nOverall, both words communicate a strong commitment to follow through on your word, but vow has a more serious and formal connotation.",

It's used in situations where someone is making a commitment or obligation to do something for someone else, giving their word or guarantee that they will follow through.\n\nWord simply refers to what someone says or communicates, without any specific meaning beyond that.\n\nThe main difference between the two words is that promise specifically refers to a commitment or assurance, while word is a more general term for any type of spoken or written communication.\n\nBoth words are applicable in different situations depending on what is being communicated or promised.",
