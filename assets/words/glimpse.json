This is useful when you want to quickly assess your surroundings or check if a friend is nearby.\n\nFor example, you might glance at the clock to see how much time you have left to complete a task.\n\nOverall, both words are used to describe quick, brief looks, but a glance is a more intentional look in a particular direction, while a glimpse is a more accidental or fleeting view.",
