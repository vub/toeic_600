For example, if you add up the total amount of money you spent on a vacation, it means you are looking at the entire sum of money you spent, not just parts of it.\n\nIf you have a total of 10 apples, it means you have 10 apples in total, not some other number.\n\nSo, while the two words are pretty similar, complete implies a sense of finishing or wholeness, while total implies a sense of adding everything up.",
