If someone makes a rational decision, they have thought about the options and chosen the best one based on available information.\n\nRational thinking is often used in decision-making and everyday life.\n\nBoth logical and rational thinking can be useful in different situations. Logical thinking is often used in fields like math and science, where following a clear set of rules and principles is essential.\n\nRational thinking is often used in situations where there are multiple options or choices and a decision needs to be made based on careful consideration.",

Logical would be used to check if the argument follows a rational pattern, and validity would be used to check if the conclusion is true based on the premises presented.",
